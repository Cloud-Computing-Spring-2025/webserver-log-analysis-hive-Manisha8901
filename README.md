# Web-Server-Log-Analysis
<<<<<<< HEAD
## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project analyzes web server logs using **Apache Hive**. The goal is to extract insights such as:
### 📊 Key Insights Extracted  
- **Total Web Requests**  
- **Status Code Analysis** (200, 404, 500)  
- **Top 3 Most Visited Pages**  
- **Traffic Source Analysis** (User Agents)  
- **Detect Suspicious Activity** (IPs with failed requests)  
- **Traffic Trends Over Time**  
- **Partitioning by Status Code for Optimization**  


## 🗂️ Dataset Format (CSV)
| Field Name  | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| ip          | STRING   | Client IP Address |
| timestamp   | STRING   | Request Time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) |
| url         | STRING   | Requested URL |
| status      | INT      | HTTP Status Code (200, 404, 500, etc.) |
| user_agent  | STRING   | Browser/User Agent |



🚀 Implementation Steps
1️⃣ Setup Apache Hive with Docker
Create a docker-compose.yml file and start the services:
docker-compose up -d

2️⃣ Access Hive CLI
Enter the Hive shell
docker exec -it hive-server /bin/bash
hive
3️⃣ Create Database and Table:

## 💾 Database and Table Creation  
```sql
## 💾 Database and Table Creation  
```sql
CREATE DATABASE web_log_analysis;
USE web_log_analysis;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE web_logs (
    ip STRING,
    log_timestamp STRING, -- Renamed "timestamp" (reserved keyword)
    url STRING,
    status INT,
    user_agent STRING
) 
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
STORED AS TEXTFILE 
LOCATION '/user/hive/web_logs/';


4️⃣ Upload Data to HDFS
First, copy the CSV file into the Namenode container:

docker cp web_logs.csv namenode:/tmp/web_logs.csv
Move it into HDFS:

docker exec -it namenode /bin/bash
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/hive/web_logs
hdfs dfs -put /tmp/web_logs.csv /user/hive/web_logs/

5️⃣ Load Data into Hive Table

LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hive/web_logs/web_logs.csv' INTO TABLE web_logs;
📊 Querying the Data
🔹 Count Total Web Requests
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_requests FROM web_logs;
🔹 Status Code Analysis
SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS count FROM web_logs GROUP BY status ORDER BY count DESC;
🔹 Top 3 Most Visited Pages
SELECT url, COUNT(*) AS visit_count FROM web_logs GROUP BY url ORDER BY visit_count DESC LIMIT 3;
🔹 Traffic Source Analysis (Most Common User Agents)
SELECT user_agent, COUNT(*) AS count FROM web_logs GROUP BY user_agent ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 3;
🔹 Detect Suspicious IPs (More Than 3 Failed Requests)
SELECT ip, COUNT(*) AS failed_requests FROM web_logs WHERE status IN (404, 500) GROUP BY ip HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
🔹 Traffic Trends (Requests per Minute)
SELECT SUBSTR(log_timestamp, 1, 16) AS minute, COUNT(*) AS request_count FROM web_logs GROUP BY SUBSTR(log_timestamp, 1, 16) ORDER BY minute;
🗂️ Partitioning for Optimization
Partitioning by status code improves query performance.

1️⃣ Create Partitioned Table
CREATE TABLE web_logs_partitioned (
    ip STRING,
    log_timestamp STRING,
    url STRING,
    user_agent STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (status INT)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
2️⃣ Enable Dynamic Partitioning
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition = true;
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict;
3️⃣ Insert Data into Partitioned Table
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE web_logs_partitioned PARTITION(status)
SELECT ip, log_timestamp, url, user_agent, status FROM web_logs;
📝 Challenges Faced
Reserved Keyword Issue
"timestamp" is a Hive reserved keyword → Renamed to log_timestamp.
HDFS File Not Found Error
Ensured file was uploaded to /user/hive/web_logs/ before loading into Hive.
Slow Queries
Used Partitioning on status to optimize query performance.
📌 Sample Output
1️⃣ Total Web Requests
Total Requests: 100
2️⃣ Status Code Analysis
makefile
200: 80
404: 10
500: 10
3️⃣ Most Visited Pages
/home: 50
/products: 30
/checkout: 20
4️⃣ Suspicious IPs
makefile
192.168.1.10: 5 failed requests
192.168.1.15: 4 failed requests
